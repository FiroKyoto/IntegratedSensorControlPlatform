ISCSP
============

InedaHime Project: 
  Integrated Sensor Control Software Platform (ISCSP) for Head-Feeding Combine Harvester.

1.
Objective:

 ISCSP supports various types of sensors, such as machine vision (USB interface, 3D-Imager[Panasonic]), LRF(SICK LMSxxx series), and GPS that are used for the automated guidance system of the head-feeding combine harvester.
 This platform can also express GUI-based real time data, and the open source platform can freely be modified and redistributed without any license restrictions.

Introduction:

 Steering a combine harvester out in the field is a task that entails heavy workload for the combine operator due to the long working hours and the poor surrounding environment, such as suspended dust particles and noise generated by the operations. Moreover, inaccurate operations of the harvester could result in incomplete harvest areas or re-harvesting of the already cropped areas. Thus, a high level of skill is required for the operator in order to prevent such inefficiencies. To resolve the aforementioned issues, there is a recent rise in the need for research and development of unmanned auto-steering systems that allow accurate steering and harvesting. Autonomous head-feeding combine is expected to be a solution to the lack of human labor in Japanese Agriculture. Our lab(Field robotics of Kyoto univ.) is developing automated guidance of the head-feeding combine harvester.
